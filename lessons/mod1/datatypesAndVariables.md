## Learning Goals

* Recognize each of the main c# datatypes.
* Speak to a few common methods for each data type.
* Practice researching built-in c# methods.

## Warm Up

With a partner, group the following items into two or more categories (you get to determine appropriate categories!)

> * horse
> * 3
> * run
> * jump
> * fourteen
> * dog
> * true
> * rock
> * apple
> * 525600
> * nothingness
> * 3.14

# Variables

One of the most important concepts in programming is assigning information to a variable.  Let's take a look at [this replit project]() to get a better understanding.


# Datatypes

## Text
### String

### Char

## Numbers
### Int

### Float

### Double

### Others

## Boolean

# Check for Understanding

- Group the following items into each of their C# datatype (are there any that could be classified as more than one type?)
    > * horse
    > * 3
    > * run
    > * jump
    > * fourteen
    > * dog
    > * true
    > * rock
    > * apple
    > * 525600
    > * nothingness
    > * 3.14
