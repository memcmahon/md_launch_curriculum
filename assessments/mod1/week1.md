# Week 1 Assessment

This weekly assessment is an opportunity for you to explore the main learning goals from the week.  If there are any topics that are unclear, now is the time to reach out for additional information and assistance!

During this assessment, you may use any resource other than fellow students.  Feel free to google, look back at your notes, lessons, etc...

## Build a Guessing Game

In a new [Replit](https://replit.com/~) project, write a program to greet users by completing the following steps:

1. Ask a user for their name, and then greet them by name.

2. Update the program to only greet user's whose names include the letter 'a' (or 'A').  If the user's name does not include the letter 'a', we should let them know that we don't recognize their name.

3. Ask the user if they would like to play a guessing game.  If they enter 'yes', have them guess a number between 1 and 10; at this point, you can set the answer to be any number you like (in the example below, I've used '7').  Give feedback to user based on the guess provided.  If a user answers anything other than 'yes' to the prompt asking if they want to play a guessing game, the program should end.

## Stretch Goals
These can be done in any order.

* If a user opts to play the guessing game, loop through asking for guesses until the correnct answer is given.

* If a user guesses something that is not a number, the program should exit gracefully (without an error!)

* Update the guessing game to use a random number (between 1 and 10)
