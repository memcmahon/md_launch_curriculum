# Lab
Lab time is designed for you to prepare for upcoming lessons, and practice what you have learned so far.  Both aspects are important for your success.  During this time, you are encouraged to collaborate with fellow students, and reach out to instructors with any and all questions!

** Instructor Note ** We are going to ask students to do some written reflection during today's lab. As you circulate among students, Be sure to check that students are doing this reflection (not just jumping right into code!).  
Before the lab: create groups of 2-3 students and post them in slack!  These groups can be the starting point for student collaboration.

## Practice

Today, we explored how to write code using Visual Studio.  This is where we will do _most_ of our work from now on, so its a good idea to get really comfortable with this tool.

### Process Review

1. Create a new `Console Application` in Visual Studio. Name your solution 'FizzBuzz'.
As you create this new application, in your notebook write down the steps you are taking - be as specific as possible!

2. Once your application is created, use Console.WriteLine() to print a message to the console.
Again, in your notebook write down what you do to accomplish this task.

3. In your notebook, write a reflection of what is different about this Visual Studio process from what we were previously doing in REPLit.  What is different about creating a project?  Are there differences in how the applications are run?

**Keep and eye on Slack** We will be coming together to discuss your reflections!

### FizzBuzz

There are a few common programming 'problems' that you will hear about over and over - they might be used for interview questions, or as an example of syntax for other programming languages.  One of these problems is called 'FizzBuzz' and it goes like this:

```
FizzBuzz

Your task is to print integers 1 to 100.  
If a number is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz'.
If a number is divisible by 5, print 'Buzz'.
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 4, print 'FizzBuzz'.

For example:
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 
11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz...
```

1. Take 10-15 minutes to pseudocode an implementation of 'FizzBuzz' - it will probably be helpful to use one or more of the methods we learned in the [Looping](/lessons/mod1/Looping.md) lesson ðŸ˜‰.

2. In the 'FizzBuzz' Solution you created above, implement your psuedo-code!

3. There are multiple ways to solve this problem - see if you can find a cohortmate that used an alternative method to implement 'FizzBuzz'.
