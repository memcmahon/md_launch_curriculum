# Lab
Lab time is designed for you to prepare for upcoming lessons, and practice what you have learned so far.  Both aspects are important for your success.  During this time, you are encouraged to collaborate with fellow students, and reach out to instructors with any and all questions!

## Practice

## Further Exploration
### String Interpolation

It is common in programming to interpolate (or, bring together) multiple pieces of data into one string.  Work through [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/exploration/interpolated-strings) to get an introduction.

### Math Operations

Similar to Interpolation, it is often necessary to do simple math equations.  Watch the video below to get an introduction to Math in C#:

When performing math, and other sequential operations, it is important to understand any default order by which our programs might perform operations.  Watch this video to learn more:

## User Input

In our [Intro to Programming](/lessons/mod1/introToProgramming.md) lesson, we learned that one of the key components of a computer is `input`.  We will be leveraging input from users from here on.  To explore this idea:

1. Work through [this tutorial](https://riptutorial.com/csharp/learn/100006/user-input)
2. Read through [this resource](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_user_input.php)
    * note that on the W3 site, you can 'Try It Yourself' to play around with the examples!

Lab Feedback
- Great work finding some decent resources to prevent "reinventing the wheel" and getting students used to consulting different resources
- It would be great if we had an overall activity/REPL that students work working through for each lab. I envision a scenario where students work through some resources/tutorials/research and then have to do some combination of writing, coding, annotation, etc., all of which could be handled in a REPL (and eventually in a repo in later mods)
- In addition to using a REPL to solidy learning + give more opportunity for scaffolded practice, I think it also highlights the need to be super explicit with instructions with students, especially in the early mods. The way this lab is currently set up, I think there could be some confusion for students about what the intended outcome of this work actually is.
